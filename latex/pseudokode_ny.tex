\caption{OWL Ontology Class Permuter}
\begin{algorithmic}[0]
\State The \emph{ontology} object ontology has access to all classes, properties, individuals, etc.
in the ontology. The list \epmh{permutables} is a list of individuals to be permuted.
The queue \emph{queue }is a queue keeping track of what the next node in the
breadth-first traversal is. The set \emph{combinations} is a set of class assertions
used in the current permutation. The set \emph{combinations} is a set of sets of class
assertions used in  previous legal and complete permutations. \emph{Unknown} is an
OWLIndividual to be permuted.
